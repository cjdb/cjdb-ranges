   /// \brief The `convertible_to` concept requires an expression of a particular type and value
   ///        category to be both implicitly and explicitly convertible to some other type.
   ///
   /// The implicit and explicit conversions are required to produce equal results.
   ///
   /// Let `test` be the invented function:
   ///
   /// ```cpp
   /// To test(From (&f)()) {
   ///    return f();
   /// }
   /// ```
   /// and let `f` be a function with no arguments and return type `From` such that `f()` is
   /// equality-preserving.
   /// `convertible_to<From, To>` is satisfied only if:
   ///     - `To` is not an object or reference-to-object type, or `static_Â­cast<To>(f())` is equal
   ///       to `test(f)`.
   ///     - `From` is not a reference-to-object type, or
   ///        - If `From` is an rvalue reference to a non const-qualified type, the resulting state
   ///          of the object referenced by `f()` after either above expression is valid but
   ///          unspecified.
   ///        - Otherwise, the object referred to by `f()` is not modified by either above
   ///          expression.
