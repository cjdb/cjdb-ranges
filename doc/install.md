# Installing cjdb-ranges

## Pre-requisites

This project currently only supports [clang-concepts-monorepo][1], with a GCC 10-compatible
libstdc++ or a tip-of-trunk libc++. You will also require recent versions of Conan and CMake for
effective usage.

### What about MSVC 2019 and GCC?

It is currently unclear whether the compile-time failures in MSVC are due to errors in the library
or missing parts of their concepts implementation: as soon as MSVC is concepts feature-complete,
this library will immediately adopt support for MSVC 2019.

Although GCC has had support for the Concepts TS since GCC 6, no attempt is being made to support
GCC 6â€“9, as the Concepts TS has been superseded and incompatible with C++20 concepts. GCC 10 support
is currently stalled by [GCC Bug 92040][2], which prevents some valid tests from passing. Support
for GCC 10 will resume once Bug 92040 has been closed.

## Installing with Conan

Installing `cjdb-ranges` is fairly straightforward.

```
conan remote add https://api.bintray.com/conan/cjdb/cjdb
conan install cjdb-ranges/head@cjdb/development --profile=<your-profile>
```

## CMake integration

### Finding the package

To direct CMake to cjdb-ranges, you'll need to add this to the list of CMake dependencies that you
import.

```cmake
find_package(cjdb-ranges REQUIRED)
```

### Building with cjdb-ranges

To use with CMake, add this for each target that includes a header from `cjdb-ranges`.

```cmake
target_link_libraries(target.name PRIVATE cjdb::ranges)
```

Notice that we change from a hyphen in `find_package` to a namespace scope operator in
`target_link_libraries`.
